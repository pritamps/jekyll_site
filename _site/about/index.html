  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hi! I’m Pritam, a programmer of sorts currently living and travelling in India, where I’m from as well.</p>

<p>I started programming when I was a 15-year old kid with the book <a href="http://amzn.to/2w0E5QR"><em>Let us C</em> by Yashavant Kanetkar</a>. I just worked through the first few chapter by myself during my Summer break, getting all the way to pointers before school started and I jumped into a very badly taught version of C++.</p>

<p>I still remember the first few programs I wrote: a game where you have to move a basket to catch stuff randomly falling on the screen, the moving tiles game, an encyclopedia of the solar system, a Gorillas clone,…</p>

<p>I would get back home from school and play, plop down in front of my computer and start playing with code. At that time, I really was programming just for fun.</p>

<p>After Pre University (or High School as it’s called in the US), I got into Aerospace Engineering research (which I loved), then Machine Learning and Computer Vision (which I also loved), and then Android programming (which I didn’t love so much). I worked for Amazon for two year and travelled solo for two years. Now finally I’m travelling and working freelance as a programmer.</p>

<p>These days, I feel that I have the freedom to again do things because I’m interested in them, so I’ve started learning things for no other reason than fun: iOS programming, a return to my Machine Learning days, Deep Learning, Functional Programming and who knows what else.</p>

<p>Whatever I do, I hope I have the patience to see it through to the end (as Neil Gaiman said, “you learn by finishing things”), and I hope I regularly update this space with tutorials, opinions, and articles on all things technical.</p>

<p>I also write about my travels and other non-technical things at <a href="http://www.pritamsukumar.com">my personal website</a>. I hope you follow me on both these places because both these distinct parts of my life are very important to me.</p>
